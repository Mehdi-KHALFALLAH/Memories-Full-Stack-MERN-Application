A social media site where you can upload and share good memories with your friends. This application uses React.js for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end and MongoDB as the database which stores all the documents safely.

Setup:
- run ``` npm install react-scripts``` (if you get the error "'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command")
- run ```--save npm i && npm start```.
